# dotfiles

Welcome to my personal dotfiles! These are being used for my Thinkpad X1 Carbon. I use i3 on an Arch Linux installation and I love tweaking that. I will try to keep this repository up to date.

## Requirements

This installation uses a few things you might need to install before being able to use this dotfiles.

+ `i3wm` as window manager
+ `i3bar` with `i3status` as status bar
+ `urxvt` as terminal emulator
+ `vim` as editor
+ `gotop` as activity manager
+ `inconsolata` as font
+ `neofetch` as system information
